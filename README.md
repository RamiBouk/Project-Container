## Données : Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

- Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes your body to attack the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body use glucose for energy.

- Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when your body doesn't respond normally to insulin, or when your body doesn't produce enough insulin.

- Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born.
